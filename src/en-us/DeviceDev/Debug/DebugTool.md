## 7. App sends configuration information

After the above steps are completed, check the “Done above operations” on the App and click Next.

![Gizwits Serial Port Debug Tool](../../../assets/en-us/DeviceDev/debug/Serial/25.png)

At this point the App will issue a configuration package and display that it is discovering devices.

## 8. Configuration result

Observe the receiving box of the serial port tool. When the following two commands are output, it indicates that the Wi-Fi module has successfully received the configuration information sent by the App, and connected to the router and Gizwits IoT Cloud.
