## 4. Details of Function Expansion Board

### 4.1 Keys

The function expansion board is designed with three programmable keys that the user can use as needed.

The schematic is as follows:

![Gokit3](../../../../assets/en-us/DeviceDev/Gokit3/manual/17.png)   

### 4.2 Infrared sensor

The function expansion board integrates a single-beam reflective infrared photoelectric sensor ST188, which has strong adaptability to ambient light. It has a pair of infrared transmitting and receiving tubes, and the transmitting tube emits a certain frequency of infrared light. When encountering an obstacle (reflecting surface) in front, the infrared light is reflected back and received by the receiving tube. After processed by the comparator, the red LED lights up, while the signal output interface will output a digital signal (is low). The sensitivity can be adjusted by means of potentiometer knob. The effective detection distance ranges from 2 to 80 cm and the operating voltage is 3.3V-5V. The infrared sensor features low interference and easy-to-use. The comparator uses LM393 and works stably.

The schematic is as follows:

### 4.3 Temperature and humidity sensor 

The function expansion board integrates DHT11, which features a temperature & humidity sensor complex with a calibrated digital signal output.  

Thanks to the exclusive digital-signal-acquisition technique and temperature & humidity sensing technology, it ensures high reliability and excellent long-term stability.

This sensor includes a resistive-type humidity measurement component and an NTC temperature measurement component, and connects to a high-performance 8-bit microcontroller, offering excellent quality, fast response, anti-interference ability and cost-effectiveness.

Each DHT11 element is calibrated in the laboratory that is extremely accurate on humidity calibration. The calibration coefficients are stored as programs in the OTP memory, which are used by the sensor’s internal signal detecting process. The single-wire serial interface makes system integration quick and easy. Its small size, low power consumption and up-to-20 meter signal transmission making it the best choice for various applications, including those most demanding ones. The component is 4-pin single row pin package. It is convenient to connect and special packages can be provided according to users’ request.

### 4.4 Micro DC motor 

In order to simulate the actuator in the field, a miniature DC motor is integrated on the function expansion board and driven by L9110.

The L9110 is a two-channel push-pull power amplifier ASIC designed for control and drive motors. The discrete circuits are integrated into a monolithic IC to reduce peripheral device cost and improve overall reliability. The chip has two TTL/CMOS compatible with the level of the input, which offers good anti-interference. The two outputs can directly drive the forward and reverse movement of the motor. It has a large current drive capability. The continuous current of 800mA can pass through each channel with peak current up to 1.5A; it also has a low output saturation voltage drop; the built-in clamping diode can release the reverse surge current of the inductive load, making the drive of the relay, DC motor, stepper motor and the use of the switch power tube safe and reliable. The product is available in a 4-pin single-row pin package.
