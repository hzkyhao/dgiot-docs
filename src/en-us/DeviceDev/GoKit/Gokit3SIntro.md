title: Introduction to Gokit3(S) development kit
---

# What is Gokit3(S)

Gokit3(S) is one of the third generation of IoT smart device development kits launched by GizWits to empower traditional hardware to access Internet quickly. After coming online, the data can be exchanged between products and Gizwits IoT Cloud, as well as between manufacturers and end users, achieving intelligent interconnection.

# Hardware structure

Gokit3(S) adopts an integrated SoC scheme with a certain level of extensibility, as shown below:

# Usage

## SoC mode

SoC is the latest development approach, that is, the combination of the function expansion board and the Wi-Fi module, which is the default mode of Gokit3(S). The shipping firmware is the SoC firmware, which can be used directly, and the usage is the same as Gokit2. It should be noted that the SoC mode cannot employ the backplane board, otherwise it will not operate normally.

The secondary development source code package and schematic diagram are available. 

1. Select “WeChat Pet House for Gokit3(S) ESP8266” to download the ESP8266 SoC source code package.
2. Schematic: http://club.gizwits.com/thread-2889-1-1.html

## MCU mode

You can get the same development approach as Gokit2 through the MCU mode, that is, the combination of backplane board + function expansion board + Wi-Fi module. To use the MCU mode, you need to update the Wi-Fi module firmware. The firmware download address and flash method are as follows:

1. Select “GAgent for ESP8266” to download GAgent firmware file.
2. GAgent firmware flash method.
3. Select “WeChat Pet House for Gokit 2 STM” to download STM32 MCU source code package.
