* Gizwits IoT Cloud: Gizwits IoT Cloud exposes a significant range of functionality via Gizwits Open API, which provides enterprise and individual developers with services such as fast device onboarding, provisioning, authentication, configuration, remote monitoring, task scheduling, and advanced data analytics. 
* Alexa: Alexa is Amazon’s cloud-based voice service that provides a set of built-in capabilities, referred to as skills that enable customers to use voice to interact with devices in a more intuitive way. For example, Alexa's abilities include playing music from multiple providers, answering questions, providing weather forecasts, and querying Wikipedia. 
* Alexa Skill: The Alexa Skills is a collection of self-service APIs, tools, documentation, and code samples that makes it fast and easy for you to add skills to Alexa. ASK enables designers, developers, and brands to build engaging skills and reach customers through tens of millions of Alexa-enabled devices. With ASK, you can leverage Amazon’s knowledge and work in the field of voice design.
* AWS Lambda: AWS Lambda is a computing service provided by Amazon. Users can write application code in languages supported by AWS Lambda (that is, Node.js, Java, Go and C# and Python) and reach out to other AWS services as needed (Ex. AWS IoT, logger). AWS Lambda lets the user manage the resources required by the computing, such as memory, computation time, etc.

Integration Principle: 

You can control Gizwits devices by calling Gizwits Open API with the Access Token returned when registering for your Gizwits Gokit App user account. Now that Gizwits Open API is also opened to Amazon users, who are able to link the Alexa Skill to their Gizwits Gokit App user accounts and call Gizwits Open API with corresponding Access Token required by Lambda so as to control devices via Open API.

https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/choosing-the-invocation-name-for-an-alexa-skill

Then click Next.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/21.png) 
 
### 3.1.1 Intent Schema

Intent Schema defines an intent that represents an action that fulfills a user's spoken request in JSON format.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/22.png) 
 
One skill can have multiple intents. To define the voice interface, you map users' spoken input to the intents your cloud-based service can handle. Intents can optionally have arguments called slots that represent variable information in the request.

There are two slot types:

* Custom slot type: A custom slot type defines a list of representative values for the slot. You need to define the type and its values.
* Built-in slot type: The Alexa Skills Kit provides a library of built-in intents, which begin with the AMAZON namespace. These are intents for common actions that you can choose to implement in your custom skill without providing any sample utterance, such as AMAZON.DATE, AMAZON.NUMBER, and AMAZON.US_CITY.

For details, click here:

https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/defining-the-voice-interface


Set the Intent Schema as follows:

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/23.png) 
 
The Intent name is “ControlLight”, which has a Slot “LightState” of custom slot type “LIGHT_STATE”.

Then it pops up a window for us to input the slot type and its possible value. Type “LIGHT_STATE” for “Enter Type” and “on”, “off” for “Enter Values”, then click “Save”.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/24.png) 
 
### 3.1.2 Sample Utterances

The sample utterances are set of likely spoken phrases mapped to the intents. Enter one utterance per line as follows:

```
ControlLight Turn {LightState} the light
ControlLight Turn the light {LightState}
```

The intent name is followed by a blank or tab, then followed by the user's sentence. For the first line, it means that when the user says "Turn on the light", it will invoke the ControlLight intent.

Then, press "Next".

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/25.png) 
 
## 3.2 Configuration

Select Configuration in the left navigation pane. Specify the endpoint for your skill. Alexa sends requests to this endpoint when users invoke your skill. You can choose to host your service as an AWS Lambda function or as a web service. Now, we need to skip this step and then come back after creating a AWS Lambda function.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/32.png) 
 
## 5.1 Create a Lambda Function for the Alexa Skill

If you have no Lambda functions yet, click Get Started Now. Otherwise, click Create a Lambda Function.

To start with sample code in Node.js or Python, click Blueprints, and select alexa-skills-kit-color-expert from the Alexa Skills Kit blueprints.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/33.png) 
 


Choose Configure triggers. On this page, you can set the event that triggers the Lambda function. Click the dotted box in the middle, and a list of pre-defined services will appear. Here we select “Alexa Skills Kit” and click Next.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/34.png) 
 

Choose Configure function. On this page, we need to provide the code related content. There are three fields:

* "Name" is used to identify this Lambda function, here we input "ControlLight".
* "Description" is used to indicate the purpose of this Lambda function. 
* "Runtime" sets the programming language to be used. You can also change the programming language used here.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/35.png)  

In the Lambda function code, set the Code entry type. You can choose to write the code directly or upload the code. Here we select Edit code online.

Here first keep the sample code and we will come back and update the code.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/36.png)  

Next set the Lambda function handler and role.

For "Handler", keep the default value.

As "Role" is related to the permission of the Lambda function, we can set the permission of the Lambda function in order to prevent the Lambda function from using services that should not be used. In the drop-down list of “Role”, choose “Create a custom role”.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/37.png) 
 

A new page will pop up and take you to the AWS IAM settings page, where set the "Role Name" to "control_light". Then click on "View Policy Document". Click "Edit" for the permissions of this role. 

The edit the permissions of this role, you can see the default value is only for log permission. Since we need to use the AWS IoT permission, so we update it as follows.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/38.png)  

Then click “Allow”.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/39.png)  

Then the page closes and we go back to the previous Lambda function page. You can see that the fields for "Role" and "Existing Role" already have values.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/40.png)  

For the Advanced settings, keep the default values, then click "Next".

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/41.png)  

On the Review page, click “Create function”.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/42.png) 
 

Now you have completed the setup. Please note that the string "ARN - arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:xxxxxxxxxx" in the upper right corner is the endpoint of this Lambda function, which will be used in Alexa Skill settings page.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/43.png) 

 
## 5.2 Write the Lambda code for the Alexa Skill

Go back to the AWS Lambda page, and choose the Code tab.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/44.png)  

The onIntent function determines which intent handler will be used to process the intent request of "ControlLight" and dispatch to the function light_control.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/45.png)  

In the light_control function, we can get the slot information of the intent. Here the slot we want to get is "LightState".

Get the slot value of the intent and assign it to the variable switch_action. Then, if the switch_action is equal to on, pass True to the switch_action_fun function.

![Echo](../../../assets/en-us/UserManual/EchoIntegration/46.png) 
 

Then call Gizwits Open API to control the device. For details, please refer to the Open API guide.
