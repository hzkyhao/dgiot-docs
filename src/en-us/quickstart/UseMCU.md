# Overview

Gizwits Cloud is an open platform dedicated to cloud services for IoT and smart devices. Gizwits Cloud concentrates on providing intelligent cloud services and IoT software and hardware solutions to help traditional device vendors upgrade their products and quickly realize product intelligence. In order to realize the hardware intelligence, in addition to the elaborative work on the hardware itself, each domain of the intelligent cloud platform, mobile Apps, networking modules needs a professional team to support. Gizwits Cloud offers a complete solution that allows vendors and developers to focus solely on their own product hardware to realize hardware intelligence with minimal cost and risk and maximum added value. This document describes the basic process of device connecting to Gizwits Cloud.

# Data interaction between devices and Gizwits Cloud

Take an air conditioner as an example. When the air conditioner manufacturer develops the air conditioner electrical control board, using a Wi-Fi/GPRS module with Gizwits GAgent, the air conditioner will be connected to Gizwits Cloud. The basic data flow between the device and Gizwits Cloud is shown below.

![Gizwits Cloud access for standalone MCU scheme](../../../assets/en-us/quickstart/dev/14.png)
 
## 4. Product overview 

The Smart Light product has been successfully created on Gizwits Cloud, which generated the Product Key and Product Secret for the product. The Product Key needs to be written by the developer to the device MCU (device main control board) , which will notify the Wi-Fi/GPRS module when logging into Gizwits Cloud. Gizwits Cloud will identify the product with the Product Key. The Product Secret is used when Apps connecting to Gizwits Cloud.

# Create data points

The data point refers to the functionality abstraction of a device product, which describes the product's capabilities and its parameters. After data points are created, the data format of the device and the cloud communication can be determined, and the device and Gizwits Cloud can mutually recognize the data exchanged between the device and Gizwits Cloud.

![Gizwits Cloud access for standalone MCU scheme](../../../assets/en-us/quickstart/dev/16.png)
 
## 1. Explore data points in detail

The basic content of a data point definition includes: display name, identification name, read/write type, data type and remarks. The overview is as follows:

![Gizwits Cloud access for standalone MCU scheme](../../../assets/en-us/quickstart/dev/17.png)
 
1.1 Display name: Customize the data point name.

1.2 Identification name: Used for application layer transmission, which is required for client or cloud development and follows variables naming conventions of standard development languages, such as containing English letters, numbers, and underscores, starting with an English letter.

1.3 Read/write type

* Read-only: Indicates that the data point cannot be controlled. The data is only to be reported from the device.
* Writable: Indicates that the data point is controllable. The data point data can be reported from the device side; the cloud/App side can control the data point data.
* Alarm: Indicates that the data point cannot be controlled. The data is only to be reported from the device and needs to be a Boolean value.
* Fault: Indicates that the data point is not controlled. The data is only to be reported from the device and needs to be a Boolean value. The cloud will gather the statistics for the data points reported by the device, which can be viewed in the Running Status.

1.4 Data Types

* Boolean type: Represents two states: 0, or 1. For a switch states, Boolean data type is recommended. For example, the GoKit development board "Pet House" has a data point of "turn on/off the red light".
* Enumeration type: A limited set of defined values for a function (component) having several fixed values. For example, the GoKit development board "Pet House" has a data point of "set LED color combination", whose enumeration values are "custom, yellow, purple and pink".
* Numeric type: Represents a numeric range. The value can be negative/decimal, and Gizwits Cloud can automatically converts a negative number to a positive one. For example, the GoKit development board "Pet House" has a data point of "set the motor speed" which supports the positive rotation, reverse rotation and speed regulation of the motor. The data point value can be defined in: -5 ~ 5.
* Extension type: Only its data length needs to be defined and its data content is customized by the user. It is used when above data types cannot satisfy the complex function requirements. It is not recommended to use this type. The data of this type reported by devices cannot recognized by Gizwits Cloud.

1.5 Remarks: Optional, a piece of text used to describe the function and definition of the current data point with no restrictions on the character format. It is only used to improve the readability of a data point. If the team collaboration is required, it is recommended to use it.

1.6 Resolution and increment conversion for numeric type data points

As mentioned above, when defining numeric type data points, the value range includes values that are not uint type, including decimals and negative numbers. Developers familiar with embedded development know that these values are not supported on the device side.

In order to make the data point definition simpler and WYSIWYG, Gizwits has developed an algorithm for converting the numeric value input by the user into a uint that can be recognized by devices. The core formula of this algorithm is: y=kx+ m.

y means "display value", which is the final value visible to the user, and is also the value entered by users when the data point is defined as Ymin (minimum) and Ymax (maximum).

x means "transport value", which is the value used for transmission in actual instructions, and the value received by the cloud/clients. x must be uint format, which also includes Xmin and Xmax.

k stands for the "resolution", which is the resolution of the user input value, which determines the value step.

m means “value offset” or “increment”. The algorithm offsets the y value by the m value according to the uint format requirement of x-value. The m value defaults to Ymin, ensuring Xmin=0.

Let’s take an electronic thermometer to illustrate the conversion process.

The data point value range: -30 (Ymin) ~ 50 (Ymax), resolution: 0.1

According to the formula: y=kx+m, m defaults to Ymin -30.

Xmin = (-30+30) / 0.1 = 0

Xmax = (50+30) / 0.1 = 800

## 2. Product requirement analysis

The product requirement of "Smart Light" is to synchronize the switch state and color combination of the RGB_LED light to the App, and control the light with the App remotely.

# MCU development for Smart Light

## 1. Generate MCU SDK automatically

The automatically generated MCU code implements the packet encapsulation and parsing of the Gizwits communication protocol, the conversion logic of sensor data and communication data. All of these functions are integrated into a simple API set. When the device receives data from the cloud or the App, the program converts the data into corresponding events and notifies the application layer. You only needs to add the sensor control function to the corresponding event handler to complete the product development.

Here choose the standalone MCU solution. In the hardware platform drop-down list, select STM32f103c8x.
Then Gziwis Cloud will generate the device-side project code for STM32f103c8x.
