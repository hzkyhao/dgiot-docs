## 2. Create a product

As shown in the figure, click "Create a new product" in the Developer Center, enter the product name and select the corresponding access method to complete the creation of the "new product." The created product needs to define the product Data Points. The Data Points refers to the functional abstraction that the product has, which are represented by different data types. For example, the simplest device “switch” has the following functions: On and Off, which can be abstracted as one Data Point with boolean type. 0 means On, 1 means Off.

Data Points are an important attribute of a product. Therefore, the first step for product intellectualization is to clarify product functions and create corresponding Data Points on the platform to describe its functions. Subsequently, the MCU protocol for embedded development will be generated automatically based on the created Data Points. According to the automatically generated protocol, developers can complete the development of smart devices.

Step 1: Click "Create a new product"

**Device connection**

![Device connection](/assets/en-us/quickstart/5mins/readme-8.png)

Developers or R&D personnel of enterprises simply download the connectivity firmware - Gizwits GAgent to the communication module of your smart device, so that devices can be connected to Gizwits IoT Cloud and intelligentized. The communication modules include Wi-Fi, GPRS and other mainstream networking types. Other connection solutions are also available, such as BLE, GSM, CDMA, Zigbee, and LoRa.

The example project of this document focuses on Wi-Fi devices. To speed up R&D, it is recommended to use Gizwits certified modules and GAgent. Click [here](http://download.gizwits.com/zh-cn/p/92/94) for reference.

**Application connection**

Developers or R&D personnel of enterprises simply integrate the Gizwits App SDK provided by Gizwits into the mobile applications being developed, which then can connect to the Gizwits IoT Cloud to control smart devices.

This document comes with a case to go into details on how to use Gizwits Debugging App to control devices. If you want to quickly develop an App,  it is recommended to use the Gizwits App Framework provided by Gizwits for rapid development.

## 4. Debugging products

After product creation in the Developer Center, you can launch smart product development with the help of related technical documents in Gizwits Documentation Center. 

During debugging, the device will be connected to the Gizwits sandbox server (test server), which provides the developer with a complete testing environment and some functions of Gizwits. After the product development is completed, it is required to request to release, and the completed product will be redeployed to the production server.

## 5. Product release

When your product development is completed, you can request to release your product. The product will be deployed on the servers of the official production environment of Gizwits, and an independent cloud operating environment will be allocated for your device for free, ensuring that your devices is available 24 hours a day for end users. At the same time, after the products are officially released, you will enjoy more free value-added services frome Gizwits, including statistical analysis of smart devices, open platform display, and various meticulous technical support services.

## 6. Mass production

After the product release, the manufacturers and Gizwits sign the “GDCS Agreement” to formally mass-manufacture the product and connect them. The mass-manufactured products will be monitored by Gizwits technicians for 24 hours to ensure the stable operation.

# Getting Started

Gizwits Self-service Development Platform provides a complete suite of simulation development tools, including virtual devices and Gizwits Debugging App. Regardless of whether you have already completed a smart device, you can understand the principle of Gizwits access through virtual devices and Gizwits Debugging App when you use Gizwits for the first time, which allows you to experience intuitive services of Gizwits access.

The virtual device is a smart hardware simulator that can be automatically generated by Gizwits IoT Cloud. It can simulate the smart device to be developed or being developed to perform device control by cloud and App, and data reporting.

![Smart hardware simulator](/assets/en-us/quickstart/5mins/readme-10.png)

In the course of development, if the formal smart hardware product has not yet been fully completed, developers or R&D personnel of enterprises can use the "virtual device" to debug and verify its functions together with formal controlling Apps so as to accelerate R&D and reduce costs.

Gizwits debugging App is the world's first-in-class debugging tool for IoT devices. Its functions can be customized according to the actual needs of smart hardware products. It can automatically generate responsive control pages with user registration, login, and logout processes, and complete the basic operations such as configuration of network access, device searching, device binding, device login, device control, remote control, status update and local/remote switching etc. for smart devices, as well as debugging.

During development, if the formal controlling App of the product is not yet fully developed, developers or R&D personnel of enterprises can easily use the Gizwits Debugging App to debug and verify the formal product functions, so as to accelerate the development and reduce costs.
