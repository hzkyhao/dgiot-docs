title: How-to videos on Gizwits App Framework
---

# Overview
The Gizwits App Framework ((hereinafter referred to as Framework)) is a product of Gizwits, which contains a set of source code for the mobile application common functions of Wi-Fi smart hardwares. As long as the Gizwits protocols are used for the product, you can directly leverage the source code of the Framework to rapidly develop its supporting App, which thereby meets the requirements of short App building cycle and low cost.

This document will introduce you how to use the Framework to develop your own App, which is split into the following chapters from easy to difficult, from basic functions to advanced functions:

* How to create a Gizwits product
* How to implement device control functions using core modules
* How to customize an App based on the Framework
* How to log in using WeChat
* How to log in with QQ
* How to use Baidu push notification
* How to use Jiguang push notification

Those functions of WeChat/QQ authentication and Baidu/Jiguang push notification are advanced features, which are not enabled by default in the Framework code. If you only want a simple device control App, just go through the first three chapters. To use advanced features, you can continue to follow the latter chapters.
