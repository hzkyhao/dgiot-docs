# How to get the Gizwits App SDK log

## 1. Gizwits App SDK for Android

The following steps take the Samsung Galaxy Note3 Lite 4G as an example.

Step 1: Integrate our SDK on Android phones and refer to the initialization process of the document on the Gizwits website: 

http://docs.gizwits.com/en-us/AppDev/AndroidSDKA2.html

After launching our Gizwits App SDK correctly, the Gizwits App SDK will output all the log information to the debug terminal and log file by default. If the phone has an SD card, the log file will be saved on the SD card. If there is no SD card, it will only be saved in the application path.

Step 2: Connect your phone to your computer with a USB cable and open the phone's SD card directory.

Step 4: According to the application that has the problem, find the package folder of the corresponding application, and provide all the contents of the folder to the Gizwits FAE.
