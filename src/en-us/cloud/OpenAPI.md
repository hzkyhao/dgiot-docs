# Specification

## Using HTTP API

Gizwits Open API exposes a significant range of functionality via a RESTful API set, which can be accessed via any client using standard HTTP.

Recommended HTTP Clients：

* GUI  client PostMan
* Command-line client curl

## HTTP Request Headers

### X-Gizwits-Application-Id

X-Gizwits-Application-Id referred to as AppID, is a unique identifier applied to the Gizwits platform. When issuing a HTTP request, your request must include this header parameters.

On the product page of the developer center, click the "Application Configuration" menu in the left column to create an application and get an AppID as well:

![get an AppID](../../../assets/en-us/cloud/get-appid.png)
 
### X-Gizwits-User-token

X-Gizwits-User-token referred to as UserToken, represents the user context during the API interaction.

UserToken has a validity period. By default, it expires after 7 days.

UserToken can be obtained through user registration or login request. UserToken is the token field returned in the response, and expire_at field is the timestamp of UserToken expiration:

```
{
  "uid": "29db4f0d806e451a84264ba3da64d9de",
  "token": "86a0ee91548f4971832e371811702316",
  "expire_at": 13894002020
}
```

A new UserToken is generated when login request is issued every time. Either the new UserToken or the old one can be used.

Because most of the Gizwits Open API are user-related, the call sequence of APIs is as follows generally:

1. Check if there is a local UserToken, and if it expires
2. If there is no UserToken or UserToken expired, issue the user login request, get and save the returned UserToken
3. Use the UserToken to call other APIs

## Encrypting Parameters

* Use 32-bit encryption uniformly
* Lower: lowercase
* Upper: uppercase

Example：

lower (md5(product_secret + X-Gizwits-Timestamp ))

Select md5, 32 bits [small] for encryption, fill in product_secret and X-Gizwits-Timestamp, without the "+" sign, as shown below

![encryption](../../../assets/en-us/cloud/加密.png)
 
# Online debugger

We provide online API debugging tools. The corresponding debug link is given in each API description.

The following example illustrates the usage of API debugging tools via user login:

* Click  user login to enter the API debugging page
* There is a red exclamation mark on the right side of the API. After clicking it, a dialog box pops up prompting for the required header information.
* The API needs to enter the X-Gizwits-Application-Id, get the AppID according to the previous instructions and fill it in, click "Authorize" to authorize
* The page is automatically refreshed and the exclamation mark turns blue, indicating that the required header information has been filled in (filled does not necessarily indicate that the value is correct. If the value is incorrect, the corresponding result will be returned in the response)
* Enter the parameter value in the input box (click the Example Value yellow box to the right of the parameter to enter the sample JSON quickly)
* Click the "Try" button to complete the API request
* The request completes, displaying the equivalent curl statement of local call, request URL, response body, response code, and response header

# User Management

## Create a user

Debug console

There are several ways to create new users:

* Anonymous registration, creating a user with a unique phone_id
* User name&password registration, create a user by username and passowrd
* Mobile phone registration, create users via phone, password and code (SMS verification code). About SMS verification code acquisition, please refer to the following section.
* Email registration, create users via email and password
* Third-party authentication, creating a user through src, uid, and token in authData. Currently supports Tencent QQ, Sina Weibo, Baidu, WeChat, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Amazon

Third-party authentication notes:

* For Google and Amazon third-party authentication, token in authData needs to start with "Bearer"
* For QQ and Twitter third-party authentication, it needs to fill API_KEY and API_Secret in Developer Center
* Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon third-party authentication can only be used in the Eastern United States and Europe regions

Password strength requirements:

* The password length is not less than 8 characters
* The password should be combination of three of four types of characters, which are uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special symbols

The main uses of the SMS verification code are:

* Registration for mobile phone user
* Password reset for mobile phone user
* Other sensitive actions that you think require a SMS verification code
The API can obtain and verify the verification code:
* Obtaining SMS verification code only needs phone number
* Verifying SMS verification code needs phone number and code

About foreign mobile phone number

* To send a SMS verification code to a foreign mobile phone number, follow the format: +{country code}{mobile phone number}. Assume that an U.S. phone number (country code is 1) is 4246531234, then the phone should be filled as "+14246531234"
* The list of country codes can be obtained here.

The SMS verification code is invalid immediately after the code is verified correctly. The default validity period is 24 hours.

# Binding Management

After a device is bound to a user, there is a corresponding "binding role" relationship between the device and the user.

Binding roles are divided into four types, first bind users: special; owner user: owner; guest user: guest; normal user: normal

## Role scenarioes description:

* When the device is not shared and the device is not bound by any user. An A user is bound to the device. The A user becomes a special user. When a B user is bound to the device. The user B becomes a normal user.
* Let the A user be a special user and the B user be a normal user. When the A user releases the binding and the B user becomes a special user, there is no "binding role" relationship between the A user and the device.
* Let the A user be a special user and the B user be a normal user. The product turns on device sharing. The A user shares the device with the C user. Whether or not the C user accepts it, the A user becomes the owner user, and the B user becomes the guest user.
* When sharing is turned on and the device does not have any user bindings. An A user is bound to the device. The A user becomes owner user and other users cannot bind the device.
* Assume the A user as owner and C user has not bound the device. The A user shares the device with the C user, and the C user accepts the sharing. A user is still the owner and C is the guest.
* Assume the A user as owner and B user as guest. The A user unbinds the device. There is no "binding role" relationship between A or B users and the device.
* Other users cannot share the device except the owner user, there is only one owner for each device.

## Binding device

You can bind the device in two ways:

* Bind the device with product_key and MAC address
* Bind the device with a QRCode. The content of QRCode is encrypted product_key and MAC, so it is essentially the same as the above one. 

## Bind a device by its MAC address

Debug console

Bind the user to the device.

# Device Sharing

After the device sharing function is enabled, there are two binding roles: Owner and Guest.

### There are two main ways to share devices:

* Normal device sharing
* Sharing devices via QR code

### Sharing scenarios

#### Normal device sharing
* The Owner selects a device to share, and invokes the create a sharing invitation API to create a sharing invitation
* Both the Owner and Guest receive a device sharing message
* The receiver invokes the query sharing invitation API to query the received invitation
* The receiver call accept the sharing invitation API to accept the invitation and the receiver becomes Guest
* Both the Owner and Guest receive a message after the device sharing invitation is accepted

#### Sharing devices via QR code

* The Owner selects a device to share, and invokes the create a sharing invitation API to create a sharing invitation
* The qr_content in the response has the QR code information, and the Owner displays the QR code image to the receiver 
* The receiver scans the QR code, obtains the invitation code, calls the get sharing invitation information of a given QR code API, and views the shared content.
* Call the accept a sharing invitation by a given QRCode API, accept the sharing invitation, and the receiver becomes Guest 
* Both the Owner and Guest receive a device sharing message

#### Cancel device sharing

* Owner invokes the cancel/retract a sharing invitation API, cancels invitation sent out, and recalls accepted invitation
* If the Guest user has not accepted it, the Owner will receive a cancelation message of device sharing
* The guest user's binding to the device is cancelled. At the same time, both the Owner and Guest receive a cancelation message of device sharing.

#### Ownership transfer

* The Owner invokes the transfer ownership of a device to a guest API and fills in the information of the device to be transferred and ID of the user to be the owner
* The original Owner user unbinds the device. The original Guest user becomes the new Owner.

## Create a sharing invitation

Debug console

This API can only be called by master account of the device.

* If the type is normal sharing, use one field of uid/username/email/phone, which is the receiver information;
* If the type is QR code sharing, the uid, username, email, and phone are set with empty values, if the setting does not take effect;
* Normal sharing is expired for 24 hours, and the QR code sharing is expired for 15 minutes. 
* For QR code sharing, the client generates the QR code image locally after receiving the returned QR code content.

# Device Grouping

Common scenarios of device grouping:

1. Classify multiple devices into a single physical space, such as a room or living room. It is easy to manage.
    + Firstly invoke the create a group API to create a group and enter the group name.
    + To add/delete devices in the group in batches after successful creation, invoke the add devices into a group API and the remove devices from a group API.
    + View all the devices under a group by calling the get devices information of a given group API.
2. Unified control of multiple devices of the same product, such as: switch on/off all lights in the hallway.
    + Firstly invoke the create a group API to create a group and enter the group name and product PK.
    + To add/delete devices in the group in batches after successful creation, invoke the add devices into a group API and the remove devices from a group API.
    + Batch control of devices by sending commands to the devices within a device group by invoking the control all devices in a given group API.

## Control all devices in a given group

Debug console

Control all devices in a group from cloud, the API can only control the devices in a group with single PK.

### Raw instructions (raw):

The default format is a decimal array. The binary_coding parameter can be set as hex and base64.
If you want to send a payload of binary 011000010110001001100011, after every byte of the binary string is converted to a decimal, you will get an array: [97,98,99];
If you want to send a payload of hexadecimal 616263, after every byte of the binary string is converted to a decimal, you will get an array: [97,98,99].

```
{
  "raw": [97,98,99]
}
```

### Data point (attrs): 

Device products must have defined data points. If you want to set the value of the extended field binary to hexadecimal 1234567, you need to pad the extended field to the given length:
The default type of the extended field is hex16, and base64 can be used to set the binary_coding parameter as well.

```
{
  "attrs": {
    "boolean":true,
    "binary": "1234567000"
  }
}

# Devices Linkage

You can create rules for devices linkage to automatically control the state change of one or more devices when the status of other devices is changed.

Devices with such a functionality need to be bound to the same user. Devices under different products need to be associated with each other at first.
After a devices linkage rule is created, it can be modified or deleted at any time.

## Create a rule of devices linkage

Debug console

### product_key and did

When the trigger mode is online/offline/alert/fault/data, the device that generates the corresponding event is specified by this trigger mode. The specified device is designated as the master device.

### event parameter

Indicates the trigger mode of the rule. The meanings of the optional values are as follows:

* Online : Device goes online
* Offline : Device goese offline
* Alert : An alarm occurred on one alarm data point of the device
* Fault : A fault occurred on one fault data point of the device
* Data : Device reported status

### event_attr parameter

When the trigger mode is alert/fault, this parameter specifies the data point at which this alarm/fault occurs and its occurrence/recovery

```
"event_attr": {
    "attr_name": "datapoint_alert",  // the data point at which this alarm/fault occurs
    "value": "1" // Occurrence/cancellation of alarm/fault, 1 means occurrence, 0 means cancellation
}
```

Notes:

* The "occurrence" of the alarm/fault mentioned here means that the value of the alarm/fault data point was reported as 0 last time, and is reported as 1 this time, then the alarm/failure occurs.
* The “recovery” of the alarm/fault mentioned here means that the value of the alarm/fault data point was reported as 1 last time, and is reported as 0 this time, then the alarm/failure recovers.
* Other situations are not of “occurrence” and “recovery”

### input parameter

Specifies the device data to be used in the rule. Each object in the array represents data of one device. Ignore this parameter when you do not need to use the device data:

```
[{
    "product_key": "pk1", // Product key of the device
    "did": "did1",        // Device did
    "prefix": "device1"   // The prefix used to reference the data point value of the device in the condition and output. If this parameter is set to device1, then device1.datapoint1 indicates referring to the data point datapoint1 of the device device1 
}]
```

### condition parameter

Specify the conditions to be satisfied by the trigger rule. The conditions in the array will be checked on a group-by-group basis in the cloud processing. When any group of conditions is met, the output action is triggered.

```
[
    [{
        "left": "device1.datapoint1",// Left operand of comparison, the type of the operand needs to be the same as the type of the right operand 
        "opt": "==", // Comparison operators, optional values are: >, >=, <, <=, ==, != (Note: Only numeric values can be compared) 
        "right": "1" // Right operand of comparison, the type of the operand needs to be the same as the type of the left operand. When using a constant, note that "1" represents the number 1, and "'1'" or "\"1\"" is the string "1" 
    }],
    [{//Each array represents a group of conditions. When all the conditions in the group are met, the group is met 
        "left": "device1.datapoint1",
        "opt": "==",
        "right": "1"
    },{
        "left": "device2.datapoint2",
        "opt": ">",
        "right": "25"
    }]
]
```

### output paramter

Specify what needs to be done when the conditions are met. All groups of actions are performed in the cloud at the same time. Each group does not affect each other.

### Raw instructions (raw):

The default format is a decimal array. 
If you want to send a payload of binary 011000010110001001100011, after every byte of the binary string is converted to a decimal, you will get an array: [97,98,99];

If you want to send a payload of hexadecimal 616263, after every byte of the binary string is converted to a decimal, you will get an array: [97, 98, 99].

```
{
  "raw": [97,98,99]
}
```

### Data point (attrs): 

Device products must have defined data points. If you want to set the value of the extended field binary to hexadecimal 1234567, you need to pad the extended field to the given length:

```
{
  "attrs": {
    "binary": "1234567000"
  }
}
```

### Output parameter example：

```
[
    [{ // Each array represents a set of output actions, which are executed sequentially. When the previous action fails to execute, the following actions will not be executed 
        "type": "devctrl",   // output type, devctrl indicates to control device
        "did": "did1",       // device did to be controlled
        "attrs": {           // key-value format
            "datapoint1": 1, // set datapoint1 value as 1
            "datapoint2": 25,
            "datapoint3": "黄色"
        }

### Raw instructions (raw):

The default format is base64. The binary_coding parameter can be set as hex.  
If you want to send a payload of 010203, after encoding you will get: AQID;

```
{
  "raw": "AQID"
}
```

### Data point (attrs):

Device products must have defined data points. If you want to set the value of the extended field binary to hexadecimal 1234567, you need to pad the extended field to the given length:
The default type of the extended field is hex16, and base64 can be used to set the binary_coding parameter as well.

# Task Scheduling Management

Scheduled tasks are divided into the following categories:

* One-time tasks
* Weekly scheduled recurring tasks
* Daily scheduled recurring tasks

The enabled status of each scheduled task can be set. Only those scheduled tasks that are enabled can be executed.

All APIs under scheduling task management use UTC time

Scheduling task management API can only set scheduled tasks for a single device

## Create a scheduled task

Debug console

### Creating one-time tasks

* repeat is set with none
* date and time must be filled in, and note that date and time are UTC time when performing scheduled tasks

### Create weekly occurring scheduled tasks

* repeat is a repeating days of each week, separated by multiple commas; For example, if a task is executed every Monday, it is set to “mon”, if executed every Monday and Wednesday, it is set to “mon, wed”;
* When repeat is a repeating days of each week, the optional values are: mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat,sun
* time must be filled in, and note that the week and time for performing scheduled tasks are UTC time
* start_date and end_date can be filled in optionally, which indicate the date range for scheduled tasks to perform

### Create daily occurring scheduled tasks

* repeat is set with day
* days is set with the date list for the task excution; For example, if the task is executed on the 1st of each month, set to [“1”]; if executed on the 1st, 15th of each month, set to [“1”, “15”]
* time must be filled in, and note that days and time are UTC time when performing scheduled tasks
* start_date and end_date can be filled in optionally, which indicate the date range for scheduled tasks to perform
